### Description about the project

As 3rd year 2nd semester undergraduate students in Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), we have to develop a web based application on Application Framework module. So that we come up with a software solution for our project.

Green Store is a cutting-edge web-based platform that revolutionizes the way farmers and customers interact in the agricultural marketplace. Built with the aim of bridging the gap between farmers and customers, Green Store empowers farmers to sell their harvest while providing real-time weather and fertilizer information. Customers, in turn, enjoy direct access to fresh, locally sourced agricultural products.

### The Need for Green Store

In today's fast-paced world, traditional agricultural commerce faces numerous challenges. Farmers often struggle to reach a wider customer base, resulting in limited sales opportunities. Customers, on the other hand, desire access to fresh, high-quality produce but find it difficult to directly connect with local farmers. Green Store addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform that caters to the needs of both farmers and customers.
