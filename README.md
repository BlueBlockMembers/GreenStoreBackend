### Description about the project

As 3rd year 2nd semester undergraduate students in Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), we have to develop a web based application on Application Framework module. So that we come up with a software solution for our project.

Green Store is a cutting-edge web-based platform that revolutionizes the way farmers and customers interact in the agricultural marketplace. Built with the aim of bridging the gap between farmers and customers, Green Store empowers farmers to sell their harvest while providing real-time weather and fertilizer information. Customers, in turn, enjoy direct access to fresh, locally sourced agricultural products.

### The Need for Green Store

In today's fast-paced world, traditional agricultural commerce faces numerous challenges. Farmers often struggle to reach a wider customer base, resulting in limited sales opportunities. Customers, on the other hand, desire access to fresh, high-quality produce but find it difficult to directly connect with local farmers. Green Store addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform that caters to the needs of both farmers and customers.

### How Green Store Benefits Farmers

With Green Store, farmers gain a powerful tool to showcase their harvest and expand their market reach. By listing their products on the platform, farmers can effectively promote their offerings to a diverse customer base. Real-time weather information helps farmers make informed decisions about planting, fertilizing, and harvesting, maximizing crop yields and quality. Moreover, Green Store empowers farmers to set competitive prices for their products while also providing valuable insights into market trends and price changes. This combination of features enables farmers to optimize their operations, increase sales, and foster sustainable agricultural practices.

### The Advantages for Customers

Green Store brings a host of advantages to customers seeking fresh and locally sourced agricultural products. By directly connecting with farmers, customers gain access to a wide variety of high-quality produce. The transparency offered by Green Store allows customers to make informed purchasing decisions, with detailed product descriptions, images, and customer reviews. Customers can explore different product categories, conveniently search for specific items, and even track price changes to find the best deals. By supporting local farmers, customers also contribute to sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices, fostering a healthier and more responsible food system.

### Conclusion

Green Store stands as a game-changer in the agricultural industry, revolutionizing how farmers and customers engage in commerce. By empowering farmers to reach a broader customer base, providing real-time weather information, and enabling customers to access fresh, locally sourced products, Green Store transforms agricultural transactions into a seamless and mutually beneficial experience.
